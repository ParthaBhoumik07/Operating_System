All of these codes were saved in my ubuntu Desktop as .sh file.
So in order to execute them.I had to go through the following steps -
cd Desktop

then modifying the execute permission if I dont have that, using - 
chmod 777 file_name [gives executing permission to all]

then executed the file using -
./file_nmae 

-thanks for reading.
